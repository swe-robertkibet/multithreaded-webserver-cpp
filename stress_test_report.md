# Stress Test Report

Generated on: Wed Sep 10 15:47:10 EAT 2025

## Test Summary

This report contains the results of comprehensive stress testing for the
C++ Multithreaded Web Server under extreme load conditions.

## Tests Performed

1. **High Connection Count Test**: Testing scalability with increasing concurrent connections
2. **Extended Duration Test**: Validating stability over long periods
3. **Memory Leak Detection**: Monitoring memory usage under sustained load
4. **Error Handling Test**: Verifying server resilience against malformed requests

## Results

## Recommendations

Based on the stress test results:
- Monitor the identified performance thresholds in production
- Consider implementing rate limiting if not already enabled
- Review memory usage patterns for optimization opportunities
